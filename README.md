# ImageEncoder

It is a java based project. I am trying to develop a system which can encode and decode images using user given tokens. 
For now it simply manupulate each pixel data by generating a sequence of random numbers and some operation on the pixel data.
This approach only uses on pixel manupulation. It does not rearrange the pixels so there are some details can be found in the encoded image.
To over come this problem we have to rearrange the pixels based on the token. I am currently working on this feature. 

The below pictures shows how this encoding works and also how some details still available in the encoded image.
